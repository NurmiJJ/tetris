# Programming Course II - Tetris
This is one of my first programming projects.
The game won't work correctly as it won't remove completed lines like normal tetris. Because of that, games ends fast.

## Controls
A-Button ~ Moves block one step to left
S-Button ~ Moves block to the bottom
D-Button ~ Moves block one step to right
